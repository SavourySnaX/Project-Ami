Instructions
------------

 Good luck at present, this is very active code and compilation is probably very
specific to my machine. I hope to improve things soon.

 A few hints : 

*You will need Mac OS X & XCode & GLFW library to compile it, it should compile for other platforms but I don't test it often.
*You will need an original A500 kickstart rom (unencrypted) called out.rom where the code can find it.
*You will need a workbench adf image called wb.adf (assuming i've not been testing something else at the time you downloaded the code).
*You will need a lot of patience, this code is hacky,slow and not really meant for any sort of public use (although it does load and run workbench reasonably ok for me).
