title: Sprites and Hires 
---

 Been a good week all told. 

 I fixed up the display hardware to cope with 640 wide screens, at present modulo and windowing are not done, and its a bit of a hack.

 Sprites are also now implemented, unfortunately slowing the emulator down a lot. Because of the way that i have emulated the screen, the sprites are being displayed in the wrong place. Well actually its the screen thats in the wrong place, but it takes some getting used to.

 There are a few problems :

* The hack i put in recently to allow the enter key to be pressed is definately too much of a bodge (key is never seen by workbench).
* The prefs application guru meditates.
