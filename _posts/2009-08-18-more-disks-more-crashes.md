title: More disks more crashes 
---

 Attempted to add keyboard support, rather than a hack for one key, but there is something very wrong in the code. Key gets stuck down very easily and once it happens the keyboard is dead.

 Doubled the vertical resolution too, that way the aspect ratio looks a lot better. Interlaced mode will require the larger window size anyway, but that is a challenge for later.

 Added multiple disk drives to the emulation. They seem to work, but if I try to format a disk under workbench the amiga decides to trash ram and crash.

 Oh and I fixed the problem with the prefs application, I accidently made an instruction privaledged when it should not have been.
