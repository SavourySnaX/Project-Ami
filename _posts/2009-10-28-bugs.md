 A surprising number of discs are starting to work within the emulator, although the results are often very wrong.

 I have fixed up a lot of silly bugs recently, both the copper and the display hardware were being updated even when the dma was disabled. 

 Frontier is now playable, its slow (but then the emulator is currently very slow), but it reminded me to fix the joystick fire button. On first run I got fined and then destroyed simply because the game thought i was pressing fire.

 On a similar vein Elite 1 now works quite well, played it for a good ten minutes until I hit an unemulated instruction.
