 Since the git repository self documents much of what I have been doing, I will generally provide a summary of work in these posts.

 So first week has gone by :

* Kickstart Rom is now running up until the STOP instruction. I need to tackle interrupts next, which potentially means more hardware to be emulated.
* First pass on CIA timers.
* Custom chip handlers added.
* Reworked memory handlers to use jump tables.
