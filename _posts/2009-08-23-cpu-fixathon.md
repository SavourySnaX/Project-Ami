 So over the last few days I have been getting my A500 and A1200 connected to PC so I could do some testing. Eventually (after much annoyance), I got to the point where I could download onto the A500 and upload from A1200. So I wrote a bunch of assembler cpu instructions in devpac and proceeded to record the results. I then ran the same set of tests on the emulator and found a whole ton of bugs. So these have been fixed, and now formatting disks works.
