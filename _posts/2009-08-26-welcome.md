 Over the last month or so, in my spare time, I have been working on an Amiga emulator for fun. Up until now I have only shared development with some of my co-workers (a few think i am crazy). This has been written from scratch using information from books, the real hardware and some searching on the net. 

 I have decided to upload the project onto github, and ontop of that actually start blogging as development continues. No real development has happened so far this week as I have been preparing to upload this site.

 The earlier blog entry on this site have been created in the last day to reflect happenings over the course of development to date. Mostly cobbled together from the git history and emails I sent to people updating them of progress.
