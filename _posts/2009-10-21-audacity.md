 Been busy catching up with other projects. However in the small amount of time I have had for ami stuff :

 Added support for adf extended disk images, only version 1 at present but seems to work ok.
 Added audio system emulation, then added enough code to get the sound output from the mac. Its disabled by default, the audio is time critical and the emulation is not fast enough to feed the buffers properly. As you can guess this makes the audio sound horrible.

 I`m currently trying to fix up syndicate to run, i've got past the first hurdle (my disk emulation was running to quickly!). However now the first thing the code does is try to wipe out all memory, which corrupts the copper list and ultimately breaks down. I`m going to extend my built in debugger, to aid in the task of tracking down the problem.
