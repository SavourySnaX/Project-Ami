 And so it begins...

 Its funny how I keep going back to emulation, it all started many years ago when I wrote SNEeSe (a Super Nintendo Emulator) which I eventually gave up work on, handing over to another individual. Since then I wrote a Gameboy Colour Emulator while I was working for a company that made Gameboy games. I also at various points made little additions to MAME (Sam Coupe emulation, SNES emulation). Then for the last 5-6 years working life has meant I did very little with my free time, until now. 

 I have decided to see how far i can get in writing an Amiga emulator. Yes I know all about UAE and its various incarnations, but I fancied having a crack at something and the Amiga is certainly the computer I have the fondest memories of. 

 Well I guess we will see how this one goes.
