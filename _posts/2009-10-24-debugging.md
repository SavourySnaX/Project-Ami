 I have spent a lot of time debugging recently, so in an effort to aid my work I have added some new functionality to the debugger.

 It is now possible to add breakpoints from within the gui, as well as view the recent CPU history and take a look at the copper in a crude dissasembly view.

 Syndicate is still proving problematic.
