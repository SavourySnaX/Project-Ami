title: Filling

 Added support for blitter fill and single pixel line operations. Games generally do not require this, as most were written in pure 68000 (elite and frontier for example do all polygons in software). I guess this made the code more portable.

 Demos do use the blitter to do polygon filling however, Odyssey by Alcatraz for instance. While testing the demo I realised I still had not put in the correct exception for divide by zero. That is now done too.

 Next up, it is really, really time to take apart the display code and put it back together with support for HAM,EHB and dual playfield mode. Also adding in correct dma timings for data fetch and hopefully finally fixing up the problems with some screen definitions being completely wrong. Phew, a lot to do, still it is nice to have a goal.
