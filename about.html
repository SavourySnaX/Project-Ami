<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Ami is a work in progress amiga emulator. It is being developed soley to pass the time. The aim at present is to get an original A500 working in a zero configuration fashion.</p>

<p>As you can probably tell, it is a long way off being a proper emulation. I have only emulated the hardware as far as I needed to get workbench running. I considered that the first step. It is not written for speed (nor accuracy at present), it won't run any software other than the workbench disk.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p></p>
<li>Fix display (ie actually pay attention to the DIW registers for starters)</li>
<li>Fix blitter (will write a load of blitter test code and try to narrow down the pixel problem on the kickstart image)</li>
<p></p>

<p>Please note this is purely a hobby for me. I work full time as a games programmer, which often results in long hours, meaning there is less time for fun stuff.</p>
